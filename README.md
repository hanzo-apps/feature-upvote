# Upvote — Feature Request Board

Let users vote on what’s next. A real, buildable Hanzo app: a feature-request
board where your team submits ideas, upvotes the ones they want, and moves each
request through **open → planned → shipped** — demand, ranked.

Built on the canonical Hanzo stack you fork on [hanzo.app](https://hanzo.app):

- **UI** — [`@hanzo/gui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/gui) (the Hanzo
  design system) under Vite + React 19. No Tailwind, no second kit.
- **Auth** — [`@hanzo/iam`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/iam), OAuth2
  **PKCE** against [hanzo.id](https://hanzo.id). No local passwords — IAM owns
  every credential interaction.
- **Data** — [`@hanzo/base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hanzo/base), the
  IAM-native, org-scoped data plane. Requests, votes, and comments are real Base
  collections, shared by everyone in your org.

## Views

- **Board** — three status columns (Open · Planned · Shipped), each a soft-white
  column of vote-sorted request cards with a prominent upvote pill.
- **Request detail** — the description, a vote toggle, the status control (the
  product team moves it between columns), and threaded comments.
- **Submit** — a form to file a new request.

## Stack (pinned)

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `react` / `react-dom` | `^19.2.4` |
| `@hanzo/gui` + `@hanzogui/config` | `7.3.0` |
| `@hanzo/iam` | `^0.13.1` |
| `@hanzo/base` | `^0.2.1` |
| `vite` | `^6` (`@vitejs/plugin-react`) |
| `react-native-web` | `^0.21.0` |
| `typescript` | `5.9.3` |

## Run it

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build  ->  dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build (SPA fallback on)
```

Out of the box it runs against **live** Hanzo (hanzo.id + api.hanzo.ai) — no
config needed to see the landing + sign-in flow. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
to point at a different environment.

## Environment contract

Only `VITE_`-prefixed vars reach the browser (this is a static SPA — no server).
Defaults in parentheses.

| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `VITE_HANZO_IAM_URL` (`https://hanzo.id`) | OIDC issuer. |
| `VITE_IAM_CLIENT_ID` (`hanzo-app`) | IAM application (`<org>-<app>`). Its redirect-URI list must allow this deploy’s `/auth/callback` — see **Ambient IAM**. Deploy provisions a dedicated per-app client. |
| `VITE_HANZO_REDIRECT_URI` (`${origin}/auth/callback`) | PKCE redirect. |
| `VITE_HANZO_BASE_URL` (`https://api.hanzo.ai`) | Browser-reachable Hanzo Base data plane. Deploy injects the provisioned URL. |

## How auth works — ambient IAM

`login()` starts an OAuth2 **PKCE S256** redirect to hanzo.id; hanzo.id returns
to `/auth/callback`, where `handleCallback()` exchanges the code for tokens
(stored in `localStorage`, refresh-aware via `offline_access`). Every deployed
app is a static site at `<slug>.hanzo.app`; there is **no server token** — the
SPA authenticates the user in the browser and carries the resulting IAM JWT to
Base. The one deploy requirement: the IAM client (`VITE_IAM_CLIENT_ID`) must list
this origin’s `/auth/callback` as an allowed redirect URI.

## How data works — Base from `schema.sql`

[`schema.sql`](./schema.sql) is the app’s `databaseSchema` (SQL DDL). On publish,
Hanzo Cloud translates each `CREATE TABLE` into a Hanzo Base collection
(`provisionBaseFromDDL`, additive + idempotent). Base manages
`id`/`created`/`updated`/`owner`/`org`, stamps `owner`+`org` from the verified
IAM principal, and scopes every row to the caller’s org (rule
`@request.auth.org_id = org`) — your teammates share the board; other orgs
cannot see it. Three collections back the app:

- `requests` — `title`, `description`, `status`, `votes`, `author_name`
- `votes` — `request_id`, `voter` (one vote per person, enables toggling)
- `comments` — `request_id`, `body`, `author_name`

Keep `schema.sql` in lockstep with what `src/views/*` reads/writes.

## Deploy — Hanzo Cloud

[`hanzo.yml`](./hanzo.yml) declares a static build (`npm run build` → `dist/`,
served at `<slug>.hanzo.app`) plus the Base schema to provision and the env to
inject. Do **not** build a container image locally — Hanzo Cloud owns builds and
deploys. CI here only proves the template compiles green.
